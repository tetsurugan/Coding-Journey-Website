            I'm going to start with making a daily  event of what i'm doing today on the 
            things im practicing on today.  Some days ill probably have some reflection
            on what i'm either thinking or where we are going from here. My current pathway
            i'm coding along with some youtube courses.  I'll link the course and embed it in the page 
            eventually so that we can all be on the same page. Somedays i'll probably focus more on the 
            styling but ill always leave an entry explaining on what i focused on today to bring some progress.
            But to be fair i'm going to start off with going through a backlog of information until I catch
            up with up to where im at. But after im done with the.

            I started html and css about a month back and im going to start by going over with what I 
            learned on Html.

            Lets start off with the basics

            Html stands for Hyper Text Mark up Language and it's the skeleton of the internet
            it is a part of the the three main parts of the internet.  Html + Css + Javascript
            which are also the languages focused up for a front end developer. HTML has the
            text write up and content in your page. I myself and writing this in html. I'll eventually 
            add css to this page once i get caught up to explaining that.  Html has multiple distinct tags
            at the start of the page we have an &lt;html> &lt;/html> which will let your text editor
            know that its working in a html file.

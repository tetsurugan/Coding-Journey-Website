            I'm going to start with making a daily  event of what i'm doing today on the 
            things im practicing on.  Some days ill probably have some reflection
            on what i'm either thinking about or where we are going from here. My current pathway
            i'm coding along with some youtube courses.  I'll link the course and embed it in the page 
            eventually so that we can all be on the same page. Somedays i'll probably focus more on the 
            styling but ill always leave an entry explaining on what i focused on today to bring some progress.
            But to be fair i'm going to start off with going through a backlog of information until I catch
            up with up to where im at.

            I started html and css about a month back and im going to start by going over with what I 
            learned on Html.

            Lets start off with the basics

            Html stands for Hyper Text Mark up Language and it's the skeleton of the internet
            it is a part of the the three main parts of the internet.  Html + Css + Javascript
            which are also the languages focused up for a front end developer. HTML has the
            text write up and content in your page. I myself and writing this in html. I'll eventually 
            add css to this page once i get caught up to explaining that.  Html has multiple distinct tags
            at the start of the page we have an &lt;html> &lt;/html> which will let your text editor
            know that its working in a html file.

            Hey you guys, im still working through this course but its getting a little hard to understand this 
            part of the video.  So with that in mind im just going to try a new angle at this and try a new course
            A little bit at a time everyday will get you some progress and sooner then later you will be so far from where 
            you started.  I sent in some transcripts today it's been over 10 years since I was in college but ill see
            if enough of my credits will transfer to the point it makes sense for me to finish out a degree with this 
            time it being in Information technology.  While definetly not neccessary I do feel like it would be a help
            in getting employment in the long haul.  Traversy Media dropped a web development guide for 2023 on youtube
            today.  The content is great something im going to have in the background while im doing some work over the next
            few days.  But not much to put on here today you guys almost feels like a wasted day. Will start fresh again tomorrow
            But the cool thing is this starts back off with html so ill be able to provide better notes on this quick refresher
            course.

        </p>

            Today I was reading something on reddit and the person suggested that you try to make a small project
            off of what you learned on a tutorial before moving on to the next subject and try to do so via forced
            recall.  I think ill give it a try when I start today. Today I started with this video         </p> <p class="revision"> This a revision from March 16,23. Over this video these topics were going discussed. h1-6 tags,p, head, body, em,a,strong,unordered lists,ordered lists, table,thead,tr,th,tbody,td,br,hr,
                form ,div,label,input,textarea,select,option, img src.</p>

            Hey you guys i'm getting back in college after a about a ten year hiatus.  I've been doing some classes
            to do so some prereqs knocked out while I wait on some of my credits to get evaluated.  I'm currently working
            on a google it support certificate for entrance to my program. I should be done with certificate in a week at most.
            It also counts as credit for one of my classes, so I also plan on doing this for some more classes.  My unofficial start
            date is in July. I can bring as much as 70% of my degree in with me with classes so im planning on doing as many classes
            as possible before my start date.  I will also still be working on the coding work too.  Something pretty cool that happened
            recently is I checked back out on the odin project.  I had taken a break from the website after getting stuck on the git section 
            but after figuring out the git on my own with some help.  I also due to some self studying had catapulted myself ahead of quite
            a few of the lessons I had ahead of me.  I have a little bit more focus on CSS on the Odin project before it recommends I start learning
            Javascript. So i'm going to keep watching  and working on whats I have been doing and taking more notes and just keep going down things
            path of learning and I should be okay.

        </p>

        <p class="entry">Hey you guys didn't make it in yesterday, I spent all day finishing my Google IT support certificate which was a requirement to get into my
            program. But I completed the cert and sent it in. Next week or so I should have the credentials needed to start the program. But 
         im going to take some more classes on the side before I start to help make my degree load a bit smaller.  Today though im getting back into the routine of things 
         ill be watching the Traversy video on CSS for more some more concrete poured on my foundation of knowledge in css.  Looking forward to playing around with selectors and elements
         Ill also be looking forward to using some of the things I learn on there to update this html page a little bit better.  After a couple more lessons on CSS i'll be ready for my start 
         in the 1000 mile journey of becoming something in Javascript. </p> <p class="revision"> Hey this is a revision from March 16th some things I picked up in this video.  It was just the basics of Css with random elements such as margin, padding. background-color, classes, id's, pseudo classes such as a:hover. also looked into changing the display settings. Text-decoration for links, width as a % for responsiveness. line height, line spacing the clear class for floats, also floats, border-radius,list-style-img, box-sizing, positions: relative,absolute, fixed(often used for social media tags), first-child,last-child, nth-child background-image, boxes also touched on some more html tags such as textarea, form, div, label,button, also did some overview of semantic html such as header,nav, aside and footer</p>

        <p class="entry"> Hey i've decided to update when I get on a different video tutorial.  My next plan is I have a few more tutorials on various subjects in css.  So i can get a more thorough understanding on the subject. I'm noticing that i'm slowly but surely picking up a few things such as organizing things by classes.  Haven't yet had a need for an id.  But I will also be uploading the tutorials I followed through on github as well.  I had a little difficulty getting that up today but ill find some time to sort it out. That way we can see what was learned i'm also going to go back after the videos and do a write out on things that I was exposed to in the video. So some of these might have revisions but they will be dated. To keep things organized. I will be working on a project of a landing page with these ideas maybe a couple at the end of these course.</p>

            Hey you guys, I ended up taking a quick break but the work didn't stop.  I did 6 classes on sophia for my degree to help accelerate through the program I will today start working on, this youtube page working on making a page with a video background I will come back and post the materials that I worked on.

            Also I talked to a mentor of mine and she gave me some cool tips on how to push a git file from the terminal

            git clone <copied path from github>
                cd into the new directory you just created when cloning
                add your work
                git add <filename>
                git commit -m 'some message about what you added'
                git push -u origin main main is the branch name only add -u origin the first time after that you can just git push

                .showcase video {
                    position: absolute;
                    top: 0;
                    left: 0;
                    width: 100%;
                    height: 100%;
                    object-fit: cover;
                    opacity: 0.8;
                }
                was a standout section in the tutorial in the css setion that object-fit: cover; helped the video cover the whole page which made the website have a video for its index page.

            Hey, i have two videos up i need to write about the last video I went through the Creative Agency Website.  During that webpage you have a page with 4 pages it connects with. A contact page with some forms in them, you have a home page with a main image for the backdrop with some javascript toggle that brings a menu on the top of the page. The work page has some flex with justify content and align content and the services has 6 cards with some box shadow in the background. The file had alot of images and they were put up with the img background.  The next page i will work on seems to be similar to the one before these 2. but lets see if there is a difference Ill do a write up when im done.
        </p>

            Hey you guys a few updates, I finished this CSS Grid video I was watching and also a video on flexbox they were both very complimentary to each other and were pretty eye opening on the justify and align options in css as well is the algn self and pseudo classes such as nth-child or nthtypeofitem and help with cards and responsiveness via mediaqueires and what not.  I also  started taking a Javascript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann to help prepare myself for a technical exam, that i'm trying out for a program i'm looking to join. But overall  I am gettng through the videos faster as alot of the information is becoming repetition which is great.  I'll be having shorter videos that i'm watching to also help prepare for the course and will be reviewing the concept here.  Todays review subject is html forms and I look forward to going over them some more when I am done with the video.
